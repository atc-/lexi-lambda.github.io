# About me

I'm Alexis King, and I'm a software developer.

I currently work at [CJ Affiliate][cj] building web services and infrastructure, primarily using Haskell and JavaScript. In my free time, I try to build cool things with [Racket][racket].

Check out the things I'm working on on [GitHub][my-github]. Follow me on Twitter at [@lexi_lambda][my-twitter].
